# About This Branch

This branch (`client-demo`) is only for showing the final **appearance** of the software. **It is not able to be used for production or even for trying.**

The branch only includes client while updater and server have been removed from here.

The client in this branch requires tkintertools 3.0 dev versions which is already included inside the `/client/` folder.
